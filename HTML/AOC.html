        of first grade, then he worked hard over the summer. Then a few weeks into school the next school year the club had it's first meeting.Students at Oscar Mayer go to the club every Tuesday.You don't need any expirience to join. The meeting go like this: 
        First, we get our chromebooks then, we do the assignment. Finally, we put our chromebooks away and have dismissal. Coding is imortant becuase we use it to program divices and robots to help make our lives better. It's fun to learn how to code becuase there are 
        so many posibilities of what you can code. You can sign up for club on the form the school send out for parrents. We are currently trying to get the club to other CPS schools althogh right now it is only at Oscar Mayer.
